## Reporting a Vulnerability

For any security vulnerabilities, please open an issue here:  https://github.com/icedawn/flightaware.js/issues

This project has automated security vulnerability checks which are routinely monitored and applied.
For manually submitted vulnerability issues, once verified, a branch for the issue will be created, and
once the issue is resolved, a pull request will be created to merge it into the master branch.

Please feel free to submit pull requests on your own for security vulnerabilities.
