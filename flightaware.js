/*
 * SetAlert creates or updates a FlightXML flight alert. When the alert is triggered, 
 * a callback mechanism will be used to notify the address specified by 
 * RegisterAlertEndpoint. Each alert that is triggered is charged at the rate of one 
 * "class 2" FlightXML query.  
 *
 * If the "alert_id" argument is specified, then an existing alert is updated to the 
 * new values specified, otherwise a 0 or blank alert_id will cause a new alert to be 
 * created.  
 * 
 * As a special case, if "alert_id" is specified as -1 and "ident" is not blank, update 
 * the most recently modified alert for the same "ident" to the arguments specified. If 
 * no existing alert for that "ident" exists, create it.  
 *
 * For a single day alert, specify date_start and date_end with the same value. For a 
 * recurring alert, specify both date_start as 0 and date_end as 0.  
 *
 * The "channel" argument is a Tcl-style string list that specifies the target channel 
 * ID and the triggering event types. At this time, the channel ID should always be 
 * specified as 16. Supported event types are: e_filed e_departure e_arrival e_diverted 
 * e_cancelled.  For example this specifies a FlightXML Push channel with several flight 
 * statuses: "{16 e_filed e_departure e_arrival e_diverted e_cancelled}" 
 *
 * The "max_weekly" argument is used to prevent the an alert from being created that 
 * might generate more alerts than desired. This check is only done at alert creation 
 * time based on historical trends for the filter selection, and is not an enforcement 
 * of alerts actually delivered.  Returns a non-zero number (the alert_id that was added 
 * or updated) on success, otherwise an exception is raised. An error string beginning
 * with "OVERLIMIT" means the user has exceeded the maximum number of enabled alerts 
 * permitted by their account type; consider disabling or deleting some alerts, or 
 * request an account upgrade. An error string beginning with "FLOODWARN" means that the 
 * new alert was rejected because it was predicted to exceed the number of alerts 
 * specified by the "max_weekly" argument.
 *
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  query
 *  {
 *      alert_id        int         alert_id of an existing alert to update.
 *                                  specify 0 or "" to create a new alert.
 *                                  specify -1 to upsert an alert.
 *                                  otherwise an existing alert id.
 *      ident           string      optional ident or faFlightID of flight
 *      origin          string      optional origin airport code

 * SetMaximumResultSize modifies the maximum result count returned by other FlightXML

 * records for performance reasons, even if you specify a larger number to its "howMany"

 * argument for all subsequent FlightXML methods invoked using your account. Once invoked,
 * the last specified max_size is remembered for your account until the next call to 
 * SetMaximumResultSize; it is not necessary to call this function repeatedly.  
 *
 * Any request that has a "howMany" argument and returns more than 15 records will be 
 * billed at a rate equivalent to the actual number of results returned divided by 15, 
 * rounded up. For example, if you call SetMaximumResultSize with a max_size of 100, 
 * then call FlightInfo with howMany of 45, but it only returns 35 records, you will be
